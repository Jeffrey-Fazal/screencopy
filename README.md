# Screen Copy Launcher (Android)

The Screen Copy Launcher launchers [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) makes it easy for the user to switch between USB and Wi-Fi

## Steps
1. Download the latest release of [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) for your OS
2. (optional) change the location of the download to somewhere memorable like C:\applications 
3. Add Scrcpy’s location to the PATH variable
4. Download this script in a convenient place like your home folder
5. Launch the script 
## Notes
USB debugger must be enabled on the phone. Most phones have an about section in the settings. Tapping about 7 times will enable usb debugging or developer options
For the first run, if you haven’t configured the device with Wi-Fi before make sure to run the Wi-Fi option with the phone plugged into USB.

## Roadmap
Add recording, multi-device support, stay awake, turn the screen off and customise file upload location.
